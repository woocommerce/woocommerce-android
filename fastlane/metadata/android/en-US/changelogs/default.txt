We're excited to bring you new features in our WooCommerce app! Users can now set a password to protect products when signed in with site credentials, enhancing security for WooCommerce 8.1.0 and above. Also, promoting a Blaze product from the campaign detail will now trigger a smoother native flow. Enjoy the updates!
