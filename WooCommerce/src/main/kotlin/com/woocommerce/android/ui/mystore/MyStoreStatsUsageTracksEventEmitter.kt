/**
 * Accepts interaction events from the Analytics / My Store UI and decides whether the group of interactions can be
 * considered as a _usage_ of the UI.
 *
 * See p91TBi-6Cl-p2 for more information about the algorithm.
 *
 * The UI should call [interacted] when these events happen:
 *
 * - Scrolling
 * - Pull-to-refresh
 * - Tapping on the bars in the chart
 * - Changing the tab
 * - Navigating to the My Store tab
 * - Tapping on a product in the Top Performers list
 *
 * If we ever change the algorithm in the future, we should probably consider renaming the Tracks event to avoid
 * incorrect comparisons with old events. We should also make sure to change the iOS code if we're changing anything
 * in here. Both platforms should have the same algorithm so we are able to compare both.
