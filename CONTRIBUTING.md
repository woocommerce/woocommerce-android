# How to Contribute

We have a very small team of dedicated developers on this project, so keeping the project manageable and stable limits our ability to accept new contributors. We are not seeking new contributors at this time, but some small contributions are welcome.

If you’ve found a security problem, please follow our bug bounty program.

Before anything else, please take a moment to read our [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). We expect all participants, from full-timers to occasional tinkerers, to uphold it.

## Reporting Bugs, Asking Questions, and Suggesting Features

* [Report a bug](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md)  and prefix the title with "Bug:"
* [Request a feature](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=Feature_request.md)
* [Chat with us on Slack](https://woocommerce.com/community-slack/): #mobile
* Submit a help request from directly within the app

## Translating

We use GlotPress to manage translations. Please go to the [WooCommerce GlotPress page](https://translate.wordpress.com/projects/woocommerce/) for more information on how to add or edit translations.

## Beta Testing

Interested in using the upcoming versions of WooCommerce for Android? Do you love giving feedback on new features and don't mind reporting bugs that come up along the way? [Join the beta program](https://woocommercehalo.wordpress.com/).

## Submitting Code Changes

Please keep in mind that WooCommerce for Android is still in its infancy and the current team of developers is very small so our time is limited when it comes to answering questions in GitHub.

 If you're just getting started and want to familiarize yourself with the app’s code, we suggest looking at [these issues](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/labels/good%20first%20issue) with the **good first issue** label. But if you’d like to tackle something different, you're more than welcome to visit the [Issues](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/issues) page and pick an item that interests you.

We always try to avoid duplicating efforts, so if you decide to work on an issue, leave a comment to state your intent. If you choose to focus on a new feature or the change you’re proposing is significant, we recommend waiting for a response before proceeding. The issue may no longer align with project goals.

If the change is trivial, feel free to send a pull request without notifying us.

### Pull Requests and Code Reviews

All code contributions pass through pull requests. If you haven't created a pull request before, we recommend this free video series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

The core team monitors and reviews all pull requests. Depending on the changes, we will either approve them or close them with an explanation. We might also work with you to improve a pull request before approval.

We do our best to respond quickly to all pull requests. If you don't get a response from us after a week, feel free to reach out to us via Slack.

Note: If you are part of the org and have the permissions on the repo, don't forget to assign yourself to the PR, and add the appropriate GitHub label and Milestone for the PR

### PR merge policy

* PRs require one reviewer to approve the PR before it can be merged to the base branch
* We keep the PR git history when merging (merge via "merge commit")
* The reviewer who approved the PR will merge it right after approval (without waiting for the PR author) if all checks are green.

### Development Practices

<!--TODO-->
Have a look at the [Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/wiki/Coding-Style) to learn how to format your code so it passes the convention and quality checks like the rest of the project. The [Wiki](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/wiki) contains all the development guides like [what a good pull request looks like](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/wiki/Pull-Request-Guidelines), and [how to use String and Drawable resources](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-android/wiki/Using-Android-Resources).
